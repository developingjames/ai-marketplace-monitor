pip install ai-marketplace-monitor
playwright install
```

### Basic Configuration

Create a configuration file at:
- **Linux/Mac**: `~/.ai-marketplace-monitor/config.toml`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\.ai-marketplace-monitor\config.toml`

```toml
[marketplace.facebook]
search_city = 'houston'  # Replace with your city

[item.gopro]
search_phrases = 'Go Pro Hero 11'
min_price = 100
max_price = 300

[user.me]
pushbullet_token = 'your_token_here'  # Get from pushbullet.com
```

> **Note**: The config file, cache database, and logs are all stored in the `.ai-marketplace-monitor` directory in your home folder.

### Run the Monitor

```bash
ai-marketplace-monitor
```

The program will open a browser, search Facebook Marketplace, and notify you of matching items.

## 💡 Example Usage

**Find GoPro cameras under $300:**

```toml
[item.gopro]
search_phrases = 'Go Pro Hero'
keywords = "('Go Pro' OR gopro) AND (11 OR 12 OR 13)"
min_price = 100
max_price = 300
```

**Search nationwide with shipping:**

```toml
[item.rare_item]
search_phrases = 'vintage collectible'
search_region = 'usa'
delivery_method = 'shipping'
seller_locations = []
```

**AI-powered filtering:**

```toml
[ai.openai]
api_key = 'your_openai_key'

[item.camera]
description = '''High-quality DSLR camera in good condition.
Exclude listings with water damage or missing parts.'''
rating = 4  # Only notify for 4+ star AI ratings
```

**Save listings as markdown files:**

```toml
[user.me]
markdown_output_dir = 'D:/marketplace-listings'
markdown_include_frontmatter = true  # Add YAML frontmatter for Obsidian/Logseq
notify_with = ['markdown']  # Or combine: ['markdown', 'email', 'telegram']
```

Each listing is saved as a separate markdown file with title, price, description, seller info, images, and AI evaluation. Perfect for building a searchable database in tools like Obsidian or for offline browsing.
